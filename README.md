## Object detection
In this code file, we use convolutional neural networks to perform object localisation (drawing a bounding box around one object in the image) and object detection (drawing bounding boxes around several objects in the image) of images containing numbers. We use customised loss functions, performance measures, and preprocessing techniques to make this work.

Side note: Due to the volume of data, I am unfortunately unable to push it onto GitHub, but the notebook has everything printed out, which may be useful.
